# TeamTamago
CSPrep project

Tamagatchiis a handheld digital pet, created in Japan.

According to Bandai, the name is a portmanteau combining the two Japanese words tamago (たまご), which means "egg", and uotchi (ウオッチ) "watch". This was a fitting idea because our group was named after one or our instructor's birthday treats - Tamago
